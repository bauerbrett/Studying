/*
ðŸ§  Problem Summary: Frequency Sort Using Max Heap (Go)
Goal: Given a string, return it sorted by character frequency (most frequent chars first).

Approach:
Count frequencies using a map[rune]int.
Create a custom maxHeap that holds freqEntry{char, freq} structs.
Implement heap.Interface methods: Len, Less, Swap, Push, Pop.
Use heap.Push() to insert all entries into the heap.
Pop from the heap, appending each character freq times to the result string.
Return the final string.

Heap Logic:
Less(i, j) returns true if freq[i] > freq[j] â†’ max-heap.
Heap ensures the most frequent character is always on top.

Time Complexity:
Heap insertions: O(n log k) where k is unique characters.
Result string build: O(n)

Total: O(n log k)

Python difference:
Again python is much easier for a few reasons. \
Has a built in counter class to count the string char and put in a dictionary
Can put a tuple in the heap directly whereas in go we need to create a struct with a char and freq field and place the struct in the heap
Can use a * to put the char in result slice by the freq whereas go we need to loop through the freq amount and add.
