# üìò Introduction to Hash Tables

A **Hashtable** is a data structure that stores **key-value pairs** and allows **fast lookups, insertions, and deletions**. It's a fundamental tool in programming for efficiently managing and retrieving data.

---

## üîê Real-World Analogy

Imagine a locker system where:


![alt text](image.png)

- Your **name** is the **key**.
- Your **belongings** are the **values**.
- A **locker number** (computed from your name) determines where you store/retrieve items.

Instead of searching through an entire list, a Hashtable uses a **hash function** to compute an index, allowing **quick access** to the value.

---

## ‚ú® Key Characteristics of Hashtables

- ‚úÖ **Fast Lookups (Average Time Complexity: O(1))**  
  Unlike arrays or lists where searching takes O(n) time, Hashtables offer nearly constant-time lookups.

- ‚úÖ **Efficient Insertions & Deletions**  
  Elements are placed at computed indices, making updates quick.

- ‚úÖ **Unique Keys**  
  Each key must be unique ‚Äî adding a duplicate key will overwrite the previous value.

- ‚úÖ **No Guaranteed Order**  
  Hashtables do not preserve the order of insertion like arrays or linked lists.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Operations on a Hashtable

A Hashtable maps keys to specific indices using a **hash function**, which determines where each key-value pair is stored in an underlying array.

### üîë Insertion
- The key is passed through a **hash function**, generating an **index**.
- The value is stored at that index.

> _Note: Hash functions will be covered in more detail in the next lesson._

### üîç Lookup
- To find a value, the Hashtable computes the index from the key and retrieves the value directly.

### ‚ùå Deletion
- The key is passed through the hash function to find the index.
- The key-value pair at that index is removed.

## üß† When to Use a Hashtable?

Use a Hashtable when you need:

- ‚ö° **Quick lookups** (e.g., finding user data from an ID)
- ‚ùé **Duplicate removal** (e.g., tracking unique users)
- üõ†Ô∏è **Configuration storage** (e.g., storing key-value settings)
- üöÄ **Fast caching systems** (e.g., database indexing, memory cache)

## üìå Summary

Hash Tables are a powerful, efficient tool for managing key-value data with near-instant access. Mastering them unlocks faster algorithms and cleaner code in a wide range of applications.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Hashing in Hashtables

A **Hashtable** stores key-value pairs using a **hash function** that converts a key into a numeric index in an array. This enables quick lookups, insertions, and deletions.

### üîπ How Hashing Works

![alt text](image-2.png)

1. A key (e.g., `Book ID: 1008`) is passed through a **hash function**.
2. The hash function computes an index based on the key  
   _e.g.,_ `1008 % 10 ‚Üí 8`.
3. The value (e.g., `"A1 Shelf"`) is stored at that index.
4. To retrieve the value, the key is hashed again, and the value is accessed directly from the computed index.

### ‚úÖ Advantages of Hashing

- **Fast lookups**: O(1) time when no collisions occur
- **Scales well** with large datasets

> üö® But what happens when two keys map to the same index?  
> That leads us to **collisions**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Collisions in Hashtables

A **collision** occurs when two **different keys produce the same index** after hashing. 

A collision happens when two different keys produce the same index after hashing. Since a Hashtable uses an array-based structure, only one value can be stored at an index‚Äîso the system must handle this situation.

### üìö Collision Example: Library Book Storage

Imagine a library where books are stored on numbered shelves, determined by their ISBN (Book ID) % 10. The Book ID acts as the key, while the Shelf Location represents the value in a Hashtable.

    The library assigns each book a shelf number using a hash function:

    If two books hash to the same shelf, a collision occurs.

    The library must efficiently organize multiple books on the same shelf to avoid data loss.

We insert the following books:

Imagine books are stored on shelves using `Book ID % 10` to compute the shelf (index).

| Book ID | Title                                     | Shelf (Hash: % 10) |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1008    | Introduction to Algorithms                | A1 (Index 8)       |
| 1009    | Data Structures: A Pseudocode Approach    | B2 (Index 9)       |
| 1010    | System Design Interview Roadmap           | C3 (Index 0)       |
| 1011    | Grokking the Coding Interview             | D4 (Index 1)       |
| 1021    | Grokking the Art of Recursion             | E5 (Index 1 ‚ùóÔ∏è)    |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Collision Scenario

- `Book 1011` hashes to Shelf 1 ‚Üí Stored successfully.
- `Book 1021` also hashes to Shelf 1 ‚Üí **Collision occurs!**

![alt text](image-4.png)

Without a proper **collision-handling mechanism**, Book 1021 would overwrite Book 1011.

### ‚è±Ô∏è How Time Complexity Increases

- When multiple values exist at the same index, a **linear search** is needed to find the correct key.
- If all keys collide to one shelf, Hashtable degenerates into a list ‚Üí  
  **Time complexity becomes O(n)** instead of O(1).

> üö® **Worst-case scenario**:  
> Hashtable behaves like a **linked list** with O(n) performance.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Overflow and Resizing

Even with good collision handling, **Hashtables can fill up**. To avoid performance degradation, they support **dynamic resizing** based on the **load factor**.

### üìè What is Load Factor?

The **load factor** is the ratio:

Load Factor = (Number of Elements) / (Capacity of Hashtable)


- A common threshold is **0.7 (70%)**.
- If exceeded, the Hashtable **resizes** to reduce the number of collisions.

### üîÑ How Resizing Works

1. **Create a larger table** (typically 2√ó current size).
2. **Rehash all existing keys** using the new table size.
3. **Insert** each key-value pair into its new index.

This keeps the hash table efficient as it grows.
