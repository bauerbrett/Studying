## Stack

Cover what a stack is and how they are used.

### 1. Introduction
Stack is a linear data structure that operates on the principle of Last-In, First-Out (LIFO), meaning the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.

Imagine you have a pile of books that you plan to read. You keep adding books to the top of the pile. When you're ready to start reading, you take a book from the top of the pile. The last book you added to the pile is the first one you read. That's LIFO - the principle that stack data structures operate on.

What makes stacks so unique is their simplicity and elegance. Despite being straightforward, they can be incredibly powerful when used in the right way.

### 2. The LIFO Principle 
As mentioned earlier, stacks in data structures operate on the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last item added to the stack is the first one that gets taken out.

The LIFO principle is the heart of stack data structures. It governs how we add and remove elements, making stack operations predictable and consistent. With that, let's explore the primary operations that you can perform on a stack.

There are four key operations that you can perform on a stack:

- Push: This is how we add an element to the stack. The element is always added to the top.

- Pop: This is the removal of an element from the stack. The element removed is always from the top.

- Peek (or Top): This operation allows us to see the element on the top of the stack without removing it.

- IsEmpty: This operation checks if the stack is empty.
