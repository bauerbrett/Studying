## Linked List

Cover what a stack is and how they are used.

### 1. Introduction - What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next one in the sequence, forming a chain-like structure.

Node Structure
- Value: The data element stored in the node.
- Next: A reference to the next node in the list.
Why Linked Lists?
- Dynamic Size: Easily grows and shrinks in size.
- Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Quick at the beginning and middle of the list.


### 2. Types of Linked Lists
In the realm of linked lists, there are several types, each serving a unique purpose.

Singly Linked List
- Definition: Each node points to the next node.
- Use Case: A music playlist where each song plays after the previous one.

Doubly Linked List
- Definition: Each node has pointers to both the next and the previous nodes.
- Use Case: A web browser's history, enabling forward and backward navigation.

Circular Linked List
- Definition: The last node in the list points back to the first node.
- Use Case: A multiplayer board game where play returns to the first player after the last.
