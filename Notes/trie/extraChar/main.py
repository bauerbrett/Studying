    ðŸ§  How You Should Think:

    Always consider the default (bad) case: 1 extra char

    Loop forward from current position:

    If substring matches word, try jumping over it with no cost

    Take the minimum of all those paths

    Use memo to avoid recomputation

    ðŸ§± Visual Example:
    Letâ€™s say:

    s = "applepie"
    dictionary = ["apple", "pie"]
    Call stack looks like:

    dfs(0):

    Try "a" â†’ not in dict

    ...

    Try "apple" â†’ in dict â†’ go to dfs(5)

    dfs(5) tries "p", "pi", "pie" â†’ match â†’ go to dfs(8)

    dfs(8) = end of string â†’ return 0

    So dfs(5) = 0

    So dfs(0) = 0

    No extra chars!
