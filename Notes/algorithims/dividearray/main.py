"""
You are given an array nums containing n integers and a positive integer k.

Divide the nums into arrays of size 3 such that it satisfies the below conditions:

Each element of nums should be in exactly one array.
The difference between any two elements of a single array should be less than or equal to k.
Return a 2D array of these subarrays. If no such division is possible, return an empty array.

Examples
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2, 6, 4, 9, 3, 7, 3, 4, 1], k = 3
Expected Output: [[1,2,3],[3,4,4],[6,7,9]]
Explanation: The three groups [1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 4] and [6, 7, 9] all have elements with differences â‰¤ k. 
For the group [1, 2, 3] the maximum difference between elements is 2. For the group [3, 4, 4], 
the maximum difference is 1, and for [6, 7, 9], it's 3, all of which satisfy the condition.
