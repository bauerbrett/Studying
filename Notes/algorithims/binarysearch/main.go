//Binary search is O(logn)
//This binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(logn),
//since the running time increases logarithmically with the size of the input. If the input size is , it will take approximately  steps to complete the binary search.
//logarithmically time - complexity increases by one unit for each doubling of data.

//logarithm of 8 for base 2 = log2(8) = 3,
//Explanation: 23 = 8 Since 2 needs to be raised to a power of 3 to give 8, Thus logarithm of 8 base 2 is 3.

//logarithm of 81 for base 9 = log9(81) = 2,
//Explanation: 92 = 81 Since 9 needs to be raised to a power of 2 to give 81, Thus logarithm of 81 base 9 is 2.

//Understanding Binary Search and Logarithms
//Binary Search repeatedly divides the search space into halves, so the number of steps required to find an element in a sorted array of size
//ùëõ is determined by how many times ùëõ can be halved until only 1 element is left.

// Mathematically, the number of divisions is expressed as log2(n) = y where:
// n is the size of the array.
// 2 is the base beacause we halve the array each time
// teh result y is the number of splits or comparisions need

//For array size of 100:
//log2(100) == 6.64
//This means the binary search algorithm would take at most 7 comparisons to locate the target or determine it's not present.
